Rock Paper Scissors Game:

Algorithm:
Start game
Collect input value from user - either rock paper or scissors
Randomly generate rock paper or scissors value for computer
    Assign rock paper scissors to different number ranges for rand int
Evaluate which input value between user or computer is greater than the other
    Define which values are greater than or less than one another (or tied if same value)
Return value which is greatest of the two
    Declare whether user won current round against computer or not
Repeat each step 5 times
Declare winner of the 5 rounds --either user or computer
End game

Reflection:
Prior to this project and the JS lessons in The Odin Project's foundational course, I had never really worked with Javascript before, and had only seen a few common JS scripts for webpages. This really got me confident in using basic JS as it felt very similar to Python, which I've used a lot in the past. It really gets a lot easier to code once you know another language!

This was a fun one too, since it's a (very basic) game. Considering my lack of experience making games, this helped me work on a lot of problem-solving skills and producing choice-based outcomes.

Overall, took me about 4 hours to complete, so I'm pretty proud of myself!
